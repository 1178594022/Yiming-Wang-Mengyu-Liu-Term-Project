## 1. The Big Idea
### *Main Idea*
* The project will focus on provide a game that provide insight to the babson community about how covid virus would spread regarding to different situations. 
### *Topics to explore and  generate*
* We want to explore that when the campus normally operate like class time, how will different situation like wearing mask, party, vaccination, and etc will affect the covid infection situation on canpus.
* we desire to generate a week by week result of people who are inffected and healthy regarding to the players input about activities across the campus. Every week the player of the game will be able to input different situations on campus in order to get more people infected or cured. 
### *Stretch goal*
* Ideally the output of the weekly activity and the result can be visualized in the interface which gives a more direct observation for the player. For example, in the game, different color of dots can represent people with different kinds of protection and health situation. We will be able to see the dots gather for class, dorm, and parties. By looking into the change of color for the dots and the population, we will be able to see how different activities and individual decisions will be able to cause what kind of situation for the entire campus.
## 2. Learning Goals
* Team Learning goal
    * Collaborate together and work efficiently as a team in terms of brain storming and coding. The major Goal for the team is to understand how can we work efficiently in a group coding project efficiently to benifit future coding opertunities at school or at work. Also, we would love to learn from each other which will be benificial to both of us in the team. The specific goal of the team in terms of this project is to provide a user friendly interface that will not only visually display the logistics of the underlying theories of Covid, but also be self-explanatory to the users which makes them easy to use.
* Yiming Wang Learning Goal
    * My personal learning goal is to learn and implement the randomization in the program. This is the topic that currently out of my imagination of coding. I would love to learn about how to present the contact between random people with different chances of inffection in coding language. Also, I would be very interested into the design of the interface. I belive that it will be a topic that will be covered in the future. But I would also love to do some self-study about it, and bring the interface design of the game to a new level that beyond the class meterial.
* Mengyu Liu Learining Goal
    * I would be very interested to learn about how to combine the randomization and probability that the underlying code provide regarding to covid inffection with the visualization that we imagine to produce. Coding to me is currently something that is on the level and perspective of the coder. I would be very interested about how to change coding and the games we design into a product that is usable and simple to use for the users. I believe that this is a important step to take that changes programs into tools and products, and I am very interested about it.
## 3. Implementation Plan
The Library Math and Random will be definitly helpful to calculate a randomized probability
## 4. Project schedule
### Weekly Schedule:
1. Research Phase: 
    * Research about how different kind of protection cause the immunization change. Also research about the how the interpersonal distance between people affect the inffection of people.
2. Project Structure Phase: 
    * lay out the needed functions or structures of the phase. Know about the general functional requirement of the project, and devide the work by function.
3. Coding Phase: 
    * Start Coding the project, meet with professor and team members for difficulties and needs.
4. Coding Phase: 
    * Start Coding the project, meet with professor and team members for difficulties and needs.
5. Coding Phase: 
    * Start Coding the project, meet with professor and team members for difficulties and needs.
6. Collaboration Phase: 
    * Put all the files needed together, run and test the program
7. Go Beyond Phase: 
    * Go Beyond the requirement and finish strong for the project.
8. Test phase: 
    * Test the program with non-python student, and ask for feedback and improvements to finalize the project.

## 5. Collaboration plan
In terms of the collaboration plan, it will be relatively flexible for our group. Both of us are roommates in the same apartment, we will be able to call for meetings any time. The basis for our collaboration will be seperated on the part of defining functions and building structures for our own part. Sam will be mainly in charged of the development of the underlying probability and logistics, and Mengyu will be mainly in changed of the visualization and the interface design. We will do pair coding when the code involves the content of both of us's responsibility and call of meetings any time if there are any issues in the code that we can note resolve individually.
## 6. Risks
The beggest concer I have toward the project is insufficient knowledge. We believe that this project is beyond our capability at the current stage. But, we understand that we are a group of students that always challenges ourselves and who would love to put in extra effort to do our own research. But we believe that we are still going to feel lost some of the times, facing the situation that we do not know what to seach about or what kind of functions or library we would need. At that time, we would definitly rely on the help of the professor to point a direction for us.
